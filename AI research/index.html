                            Hi guys. I set up this page to give some guidance around your use/investigations of ChatGPT.
                            <br><br>
                            If you're keen to give this a good play, <strong>make sure you use it yourself first</strong> so the following
                            questions don't influence your actions/thoughts.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>First of all, <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">click on this is link</a> to go to ChatGPT.</strong> 
                            Create an account if you haven't done so already.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Ideas to use in ChatGPT</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ask it to translate something</strong> (phrase, sentence, word) from one language to another</li>
                            <li><strong>Ask it to write a story</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ask it to write a story in a certain style such as author or structure (Dr. Seuss, poem, Eminem, joke, etc.)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Ask it for instructions on something</strong> (build a table, cook a roast, etc.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Ask how something works</strong> (car, medicine, human body, plane, stock market, etc.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Ask it about history</strong> (the release of the first xbox, who invented peanut butter, etc.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Ask it about itself</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Ask it anything you want!</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Feel free to give your questions <strong>context</strong> as well (i.e. <strong>why</strong> 
                            was the creation of the Model T Ford so <strong>important</strong>, <strong>how</strong> did the invention of the 
                            microprocessor <strong>change the world</strong>)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Don't forget to have fun and let me know what you think.
                            Enjoy!

                        <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Here is a brief explanation of what ChatGPT is, for those interested:
                            <br><br>
                            ChatGPT is a natural language processing chatbot developed by OpenAI, released November 2022.
                            <br><br>
                            It is built on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) family of large language models.
                            What this means is that it is essentially a large neural network trained on large quantities of unlabelled 
                            text using self-supervised learning. This means that it fed a lot of data (300 billion words with 175 billion parameters, 
                            from the internet and human feedback) and draws conclusions/relationships itself. It also has supervised/enforced 
                            learning from human feedback to curb any errors and minimize bias from the data.
                            <br><br>
                            The model is built on a supercomputer infrastructure using Nvidia GPU's with more than 285,000 CPU 
                            Cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 Gigabit per second of network connectivity for each GPU Server. In comparison, 
                            a typical laptop will have 4-8 CPU cores, 0-1 GPU cores and maximum 1 Gigabit per second network connectivity.
                            <br><br>
                            Its estimated value is $29 billion dollars.
                            <br><br>
                            ChatGPT is part of an AI category called narrow AI. 
                            Narrow AI is an AI structure that is tasked with a very limited (or narrow) scope, such as chatting, image generation, 
                            voice assistants (Alexa), etc.
